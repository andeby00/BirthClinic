The following list describes all our decisions and assumptions:

Must haves:
* The system Must have a way to check for active births 
* The system Must have a way to check for working Clinicians

Should have
* The system Should be able to seed data through functions


Other considerations
* All working staff are considered clinicians since they work in a clinic
